# Reseach on Inverse Kinematics

This project consists of 2 parts:  
- First is Unity project about 2D IK segment movement  
- The second one is Blender project.

### Unity project

Demonstration of 2D Inverse Kinematics on robot arm with adjustable segments. Segments are mutually connected and on user mouse click are changing positions and rotations depending on current mouse location. Each arm segment is moving by principles of IK.

### Blender project

This project is about making short animation where we can see created models, character animation, effects, camera movement and rendering video. Everything in this video is created by me except of X-wing starfighter and BB8. Main focus in this work is about understading IK and how to use it in practice. Other included parts of this project is my curiosity about how other stuff works in Blender.

The video of rendered animation can be seen on following link:
